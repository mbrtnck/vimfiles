# vimfiles

A set of my configuration files for the Vim text editor. This is a
compilation of various different configs I've made for myself over the
years since I was introduced to Vim in 2002; gathered together, cleaned
up and updated. It's the oldest and longest evolving work of myself
ever published.

## Installation

Just clone the repository as it is, directly into your home directory. The
following commands are common for both Windows and Linux, provided that
working Git installation is available:

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/mbrtnck/vimfiles

That's it!
