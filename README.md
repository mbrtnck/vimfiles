# vimfiles

A set of my configuration files for [Vim][00] text editor. This is a
compilation of many different configs I've made for myself over the
years since I was introduced to Vim in 2002. All gathered together, cleaned
up and updated. It's my oldest and longest evolving work I've ever published.

## Installation

For both Windows and Linux, working installation of Git is required. Use
the right command for your operating system.

### Windows

Just clone the repository as it is, directly into your home directory:

    git clone https://github.com/mbrtnck/vimfiles ~

### Linux

Clone the repository content into `.vim` subfolder of your home directory:

    git clone https://github.com/mbrtnck/vimfiles ~/.vim

That's it!
